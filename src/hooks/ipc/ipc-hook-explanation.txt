In this folder there are several hooks which all utilize the ipcRenderer
import from Electron.

Think of these as event listeners from Vanilla Javascript, where the event
is the name of the channel (string), and the handler is a redux action.
In addition, many of these redux functions have an un-used first parameter,
because you can't access the data from electron/selenium without it.

Additionally these hooks return a cleanup function inside the useEffect 
which removes the "event listener". This is because when react re-renders
the component, it re-adds the listeners and causes functions to fire more
than once undesirably. Removing the listener on re-render prevents this
from transpiring.

Although some of these hooks are not used in more than one place, because
of the common patterns explained above and their verbose nature, they are
abstracted to improve code readability.
